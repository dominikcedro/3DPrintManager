## App that helps manage 3D printer among many people. It's meant to save your time.

### Project overview

* This project is my first big endeavour with Kotlin language.
* App is meant to help me and my colleagues in scientific club "Bioaddmed" at Wroc≈Çaw TECH.
* It should run on android 11 or higher with connection to internet.

### Key features

* Login and registration avaible through firebase.
* Users of the app can request the time they want to use the printer to notice other users.
* Reports can be posted about current state of printer, to notice other users if there are any technical issues pending.

### Technologies used

* Kotlin
* Android Studio giraffe and hedghog (with new UI)
* Firebase - AUTH, Firestore and email NOTI

### Plans for the future

As of 06.02.2024 my plans for the app are:

* Improve UI design (underway).
* Introduce filament database that will help users manage the filament levels for each printer.
* Let users create their own printer profiles.
* Create simple RaspberryPi live camera that will let users check the print progress.
